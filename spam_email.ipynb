      "Subject: Qovery Changelog #37 | Access to Old Deployment Logs, User Mapper Update, Advanced Settings Addition... What's new? It's Wednesday, and you know what that means! Here's a list of the stuff we shipped during the past weeks: Access to Old Deployment Logs Now, users can easily toggle between previous deployment logs using the dropdown menu from the logs view or the \"Deployments\" tab. [Image \"2d1af28a347f4a30b75d435e878ff2c2-with-play.gif\"] This feature enhances the visibility of past deployments, allowing developers to analyze historical data and troubleshoot effectively, reducing time and effort in tracking changes. [Image \"78650d5bf5874b32a3ad5a51d9629788-with-play.gif\"] User Mapper Update We have transitioned from a fixed IAM user setup to roles. This change applies only to created users, not the main cluster installation user. By introducing this flexibility, we are empowering you to manage access controls more dynamically, thereby enhancing security and simplifying the user management process. You can check out our open source project to provide this feature. You can also take a look at this thread on our forum to understand the motivation. Pod Anti-Affinity and Node Affinity The introduction of pod anti-affinity and node affinity as customization options ensures more refined control over your deployment. It allows you to guide the scheduler on how to place Pods relative to other Pods, matching your specific needs and system requirements. This leads to more efficient resource utilization and increased performance. [Image \"CleanShot+2023-08-22+at+7.47.18%402x.jpg\"] Read the full changelog You can reply to this email with thoughts/feedback on the changes we're making, or even better, contact us on our Forum! Regards, Albane from the Qovery team.\n",

It’s hard to know in advance the result of a hyperparameter choice, dataset, or prompt to a large language model (LLM). You just have to try it, get a result, and decide on the next step. Still, understanding how the underlying technology works is very helpful for picking a promising direction. For example, when prompting an LLM, which of the following is more effective? Prompt 1: [Problem/question description] State the answer and then explain your reasoning. Prompt 2: [Problem/question description] Explain your reasoning and then state the answer. These two prompts are nearly identical, and the former matches the wording of many university exams. But the second prompt is much more likely to get an LLM to give you a good answer. Here’s why: An LLM generates output by repeatedly guessing the most likely next word (or token). So if you ask it to start by stating the answer, as in the first prompt, it will take a stab at guessing the answer and then try to justify what might be an incorrect guess. In contrast, prompt 2 directs it to think things through before it reaches a conclusion. This principle also explains the effectiveness of widely discussed prompts such as “Let’s think step by step (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWLCs821ZBk2W3c59kM1zQVVnW93kvSZ52CrzTN3X6VHb3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3njW776fHg2C5Q7fW5Jm06g4bc-_cW3cy7sK5JY0RlW3BYsXh87WzmbW33X5Gs7JNgFhW3KYCtp4njqyMW2jJFSm3t9vs6W61KlF82_xxZJW7p48bJ4QNc0BW9bdS8d5y_JgbW6gf6vv25Jv5kW7XQKsn5RshcKW4f7tfd43jL-6W19GHsT6_jvXkW2yZhdX19k4PHTBnGB2x53wVW6PzBJF2y0sqDW8Vj0Z34XpkLjW3-ygdQ69qvfMW7Vmd-w7skR0vW3dDtHp8cnX3PW81DNLS4Hrv2DdtTx0W04 ) .” The image above illustrates this difference using a question with one right answer. But similar considerations apply when asking an LLM to make judgment calls when there is no single right answer; for example, how to phrase an email, what to say to someone who is upset, or the proper department to route a customer email to. That’s why it’s helpful to understand, in depth, how an algorithm works. And that means more than memorizing specific words to include in prompts or studying API calls. These algorithms are complex, and it’s hard to know all the details. Fortunately, there’s no need to. After all, you don’t need to be an expert in GPU compute allocation algorithms to use LLMs. But digging one or two layers deeper than the API documentation to understand how key pieces of the technology work will shape your insights. For example, in the past week, knowing how long-context transformer networks process input prompts and how tokenizers turn an input into tokens shaped how I used them. A deep understanding of technology is especially helpful when the technology is still maturing. Most of us can get a mature technology like GPS to perform well without knowing much about how it works. But LLMs are still an immature technology, and thus your prompts can have non-intuitive effects. Developers who understand the technology in depth are likely to build more effective applications, and build them faster and more easily, than those who don't. Technical depth also helps you to decide when you can’t tell what’s likely to work in advance, and when the best approach is to try a handful of promising prompts, get a result, and keep iterating. Keep learning! Andrew P.S. Our short course on fine-tuning LLMs is now available!

Fine-tuning can deliver superior results, and it can be done relatively inexpensively. In this course, Sharon Zhou, CEO and co-founder of Lamini (disclosure: I’m a minor shareholder) shows you how to recognize when fine-tuning can be helpful and how to do it with an open-source LLM.

From negotiation to mandate: The 173-year-old publisher, which has nearly 10 million subscribers across online and print formats, was negotiating with OpenAI to use its material, but talks recently broke down. The New York Times had more success with Google: In February, Google agreed to pay around $100 million to use Times content in search results, although an agreement on AI training was not reported. - The updated The New York Times terms of service prohibit visitors from using text, images, video, audio, or metadata to develop software or curate third-party datasets without explicit permission. The prohibition on software development explicitly includes training machine learning or AI systems. (The terms of service previously prohibited the use of web crawlers to scrape the publisher’s data without prior consent.) - People with knowledge of the potential lawsuit said The New York Times worried that readers could get its reporting directly from ChatGPT. - It’s unclear (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWLCs821ZBk2W3c59kM1zQVVnW93kvSZ52CrzTN3X6VJ43prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3nXW8-pQHL6Yztf0W5MKnCr7ph8p8VNtl918q3MsQW98NJs24t350RW38fnfX2CwqXBW7tGbZW14XLgJW5whD5v6xH23cW8B-XSm1qnT_WW8Wsrjp4Z5M1YW7B7MBV7VNSXXN9j9pCTFtYWdN7mW-cFBqQkbW8BZt2H2K8WSLW4qhKLs5HQRK9W3fTHSM4Sbs82W8_ZVk99kFpXfW4sgFx03WH3B2VwG1XV5tFwMvW1V6-bB1GBP6gN65Ly3Gl-XdMW8rKbH876DHnkW2w96l44HZyYyW174WBR3ZK5-jW1szWpM4NTBVsW8SMGZm4Ykd19W89FRwC6jsZVgW1HnffK4yGpckW5vg0yx3bCYj7dgbWp204 ) whether existing United States copyright law protects against AI training. If a judge were to rule in favor of The New York Times, OpenAI might have to pay up to $150,000 per instance of copyright infringement and possibly destroy datasets that contain related works.

Why it matters: Large machine learning models rely on training data scraped from the web as well as other freely available sources. Text on the web is sufficiently plentiful that losing a handful of sources may not affect the quality of trained models. However, if the norms were to shift around using scraped data to train machine learning models in ways that significantly reduced the supply of high-quality data, the capabilities of trained models would suffer. We’re thinking: Society reaps enormous rewards when people are able to learn freely. Similarly, we stand to gain incalculable benefits by allowing AI to learn from information available on the web. An interpretation of copyright law that blocks such learning would hurt society and derail innovation.

What’s new: At the annual Defcon hacker convention in Las Vegas, 2,200 people competed to break guardrails around language models, The New York Times reported (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWLCs821ZBk2W3c59kM1zQVVnW93kvSZ52CrzTN3X6VHP3prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3p7N21J71--yDDtW56GQXw5NkrsvW1Jpqtq8XZ-WXW8m3f1F7D_9fLW1hcLpV51f1BsW974sGt3Jb0gGW8pd4Hq6nhqB6W2YYs_x7VSs9NN5kxsv01gvJKVYDMDP46SNCBVWhg7V6bwGhtW71BxHn47WdwMW1QWBXJ3P87z6W1Bfb_d6RhZdqW7MTV821Wt4qtW5H0YyF6Br0BhW4y0mhY12TM7SVs3GLL4dzR0pW2wwX19996R-RW1sgTCC7tND60N5ywYgYCQlZ4W4tqQ5z6g7pH2W8WDn-21wRPr9W6km8l_6gcG6DW2FPNYQ7HD3RbV_nf7m37bGNCf86Nbr604 ) . The contest, which was organized by AI safety nonprofits Humane Intelligence and SeedAI and sponsored by the White House and several tech companies, offered winners an Nvidia RTX A6000 graphics card. Breaking models: Contestants in the Generative Red Team Challenge had 50 minutes to perform 21 tasks of varying difficulty, which they selected from a board like that of the game show Jeopardy. Seven judges scored their submissions. - Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Nvidia, OpenAI, and Stability AI provided large language models for competitors to poke and prod. - Among the flaws discovered: inconsistencies in language translations, discrimination against a job candidate based on caste, and a reference to a nonexistent 28th amendment to the United States Constitution. - Two of the four winning scores were achieved by Stanford computer science Cody Ho, who entered the contest five times. - The organizers plan to release the contestants’ prompts and model outputs to researchers in September 2023 and a public dataset in August 2024. Behind the news: Large AI developers often test their systems by hiring hackers called “red teams,” a term used by the United States military to represent enemy forces in Cold War-era war games, to attack them. - Google shed light on (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWLCs821ZBk2W3c59kM1zQVVnW93kvSZ52CrzTN3X6VJn3prCCW95jsWP6lZ3mdW1v0FJY5sp8T3W4B2FCZ5J6rZLW2J2Q9K4kWPQ2W7kYs6K8yQ7zYW1qbHhL93M7-RVYq0Bp1cX8H1W1Mqxnx6KBrqrW69gS9w3p1v6dW1cVBLm4gZwSvW7RGr5s237lYwW2PYTBB1XqKKdN85g9C5Pbp1PW3ldygD5pHvW5W2DPnHX41d8h0TlYVd2KgZCZW7_4wyp4Q8jy1W6ZGXJc2x76FXM3xY-pR5MTlW7RYyHd4KxrSrW4YlJFv5fNMpCW16DQMq2XZGk9VRjVzw7t0pczW2QHfd27JsgvjW6t8ZVh5rqhHzVP2SYm2z1JkCW7WKZVk4q42z6W81jbnt7Pln8yW3qPglY8dpgw6W8zM5P98sWslxW5WsnTR8vWcyFd1Mrhb04 ) its red team in a July blog post.

They coaxed the model to produce chemical weapon recipes, made-up words in Farsi, and racial stereotypes before developers fine-tuned the model to avoid such behavior. Why it matters: The security flaws found in generative AI systems are distinctly different from those in other types of software. Enlisting hackers to attack systems in development is essential in sniffing out flaws in conventional software. It’s a good bet for discovering deficiencies in AI models as well.

Each chip fills an entire silicon wafer, which is typically divided into smaller chips. It holds 2.6 trillion transistors organized into 850,000 cores, compared to an Nvidia H100 GPU, which has 80 billion transistors and around 19,000 cores. - CG-1 comprises 32 Cerebras chips (soon to be upgraded to 64), which process AI operations, as well as 82 terabytes of memory. Over 72,700 AMD EPYC cores handle input and output processing. - Each supercomputer will run at 4 exaflops (4 quintillion floating point operations per second) peak performance. In comparison, Google’s Cloud TPU v4 Pods deliver 1.1 exaflops. - The architecture enables processing to be distributed among all the chips with minimal loss of efficiency.

Why it matters: The rapid adoption of generative AI is fueling demand for the huge amounts of processing power required to train and run state-of-the-art models. In practical terms, Nvidia is the only supplier of tried-and-true AI chips for large-scale systems. This creates a risk for customers who need access to processing power and an opportunity for competitors who can satisfy some of that demand. We’re thinking: As great as Nvidia’s products are, a monopoly in AI chips is not in anyone’s best interest. Cerebras offers an alternative for training very large models. Now cloud-computing customers can put it to the test. Vision Transformers Made Manageable Vision transformers typically process images in patches of fixed size. Smaller patches yield higher accuracy but require more computation. A new training method lets AI engineers adjust the tradeoff. What's new: Lucas Beyer and colleagues at Google Research trained FlexiViT (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWLCs821ZBk2W3c59kM1zQVVnW93kvSZ52CrzTN3X6VHb3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3pVW9b97-_8nHH5ZVYpZjB7k1tf9W6_lZpC7BV_VpVPy-fY2kPXC4W40Kr1k7FxgNdW6Yr3Tk5VJ5j9V4kxkq2Vf89pW1QkcCX3p4VhWW7fh4Yh6Dl8y4W7cmwcD7g3GvqVKK8Jg2Bj5vYN44znJJpb1S3W4bSwhY2XNvdrN8qGbY9CxdSWW4y2Qs654H0BlW632gY-2KJdGsW7XJv_b1bBllHV-Xx9f3l0LkYW3gB8_t20W1lkN1NY3_58lMvRW31lPfX7lglc-W2Gls_97qF9J8f57QPWC04 ) , a vision transformer that allows users to specify the desired patch size. Key insight: Vision transformers turn each patch into a token using two matrices of weights, whose values describe the patch’s position and appearance. The dimensions of these matrices depend on patch size. Resizing the matrices enables a transformer to use patches of arbitrary size. How it works: The authors trained a standard vision transformer on patches of random sizes between 8x8 and 48x48 pixels. They trained it to classify ImageNet-21K (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWLCs821ZBk2W3c59kM1zQVVnW93kvSZ52CrzTN3X6VHb3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3m8W6Kjj278gDVcHW8_QdGm4xjvHcVtT42f2YnCznW3lvk764DbhHqW6QgBJX95S7tNN48Ymf9WDZ3MW4P7BJt8dPHTgV3pY5_8zTjgdW2rX7LB70rQngVlPvBN4cS_9rW8Dzjdm6yWnTgW8vMG4w54hNBsW9hhX734RGjvBW1C9Br65wjTBPW3TMmdD1yP-9NW7nftdL443s-HW8MSPcD86KBtzW6CSCyr3MsJKcW4dbzbT5HwD-fN97MzSMYN6TvW4L3MDX8wmMnNW5-WBS_403QHyf1dG4xC04 ) (256x256 pixels). - FlexiVit learned a matrix of size 32x32 to describe each patch’s appearance and a matrix of size 7x7 to describe its position. - Given an image, FlexiViT resized the matrices according to the desired patch size without otherwise changing the architecture. To accomplish this, the authors developed a complicated method they call pseudo-inverse resize (PI resize). Results: The authors compared FlexiVit to two vanilla vision transformers, ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/30 (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWLCs821ZBk2W3c59kM1zQVVnW93kvSZ52CrzTN3X6VHb3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3msW6FHp6h4jCFqPW2r0WC75WRMMcW80r8Qh1MjYZpW7b1Hn27YDp5pW80SRrH46ll53W8DxX-c1tHtCNW5Q8RVM8gr-p2W8KMgMf4Fd8cNW7SB02g8NNYzsW7_sCzq7Vlh4sW4lBNCX2vz9tPW2GsXNM20yzGDW6Xb6xk5Tq8yzW4fq5p482R2-SW1wCYmV1X9Rc6VQFhxK5FTMwlW8N6st95ZXj12W8R17PJ7lH1r5N7Syns0508L1W72g0q81nd_6MW34_fQG3R1fgQW3SgNCY5Lz3kBdCLyK004 ) , trained on ImageNet-21k using patch sizes of 16x16 and 30x30 respectively. Given patches of various sizes, the vanilla vision transformers’ position and appearance matrices adjusted in the same manner as FlexiViT’s. FlexiViT performed consistently well across patch sizes, while the models trained on a fixed patch size performed well only with that size. For example, given 8x8 patches, FlexiViT achieved 50.2 percent precision; ViT-B/16 achieved 30.5 percent precision, and ViT-B/30 achieved 2.9 percent precision. Given 30x30 patches, FlexiViT achieved 46.6 percent precision, ViT-B/16 achieved 2.4 percent precision, and ViT-B/30 achieved 47.1 percent precision. Why it matters: The processing power available often depends on the project. This approach makes it possible to train a single vision transformer and tailor its patch size to accommodate the computation budget at inference. We're thinking: Unlike text transformers, for which turning text into a sequence of tokens is relatively straightforward, vision transformers offer many possibilities for turning an image into patches and patches into tokens. It’s exciting to see continued innovation in this area. Work With Andrew Ng Join the teams that are bringing AI to the world!

Explain your case succinctly and with data to stand the best chance. c. Keep in mind that many states in the US have a salary history ban https://email.levels.fyi/t/c/c6036a7d-d127-43ac-a955-e16e375497ad/01899f16-64e4-b4cb-a26f-1e9c3a9d7150 .

How Do You Get Experience… Without Experience? 🛠️ Levels.fyi Co-Founder, Zaheer, shares his thoughts on this age-old question. A classic catch-22: You need experience to get a job... but you don't have a job. What do you put on your resume? We've seen this question a lot lately, given the intern & full time hiring slump. New grads are having an extraordinarily difficult time standing out and getting jobs. So what do you do? Create your own experiences. It demonstrates competence and shows passion. How? Build something. And if you can't, write about something. For Software and other roles where there's low barriers to entry, building something is easy. If you're interested in photography you could build a site that lets you do some basic editing. If you're into data, you can find a public data set, analyze it and publish your findings. If you're into gaming, you can build a game. Just build something. You'll automatically be ahead of 99% of people that haven't built anything from scratch on their own. For careers that have high barriers of entry (ex. biologist, chemists, etc.), write about something. As an example, the science world has been excited recently about a new superconductor discovery (LK-99). You could start a Twitter (X?) account documenting people's replication attempts and summarizing it for the masses. Or write a blog summarizing the research around it. In all cases, doing something, doing anything, is better than having nothing on your resume. Be wary of class projects and common ideas. Do something that is unique. At the very least, you'll learn something new while creating your own experiences.

A question we get a lot is: How long should my resume be? The short answer is: It depends. While one-page resumes are still the preferred format, we’re seeing a lot more cases where 2 or more pages make more sense, so we wanted to outline a few thoughts on when it makes sense to expand a bit. One page resumes are still the preferred format because, honestly, recruiters don’t have enough time in the day to read through multi-page resumes and they need to make quick and effective hiring decisions. If you can reduce your resume to one-page, we definitely advise it. That said, sometimes 2 pages (or, in very rare cases, 3+ pages) make sense. If you’re someone with a wealth of professional experience and are targeting high level roles like Principal, Staff, or Executive Leadership roles, then 2-page resumes are a lot more common. It’s important to showcase the breadth and depth of your experience for those level of roles, so showing the growth and evolution of your experience will go a long way. At the end of the day, the idea is to know your audience and know what role you’re applying for. If you’re applying for a junior or mid-level engineer, you don’t need to include your first job as a restaurant server. Instead, use that space to showcase personal projects or to expand on your relevant experience. ‌ If you’re having trouble figuring out what’s relevant or how long your resume should be, be sure to check out our resume coaching https://email.levels.fyi/t/c/a9a1b2fa-2e9c-4805-ae2a-7160f1b52d47/01899f16-64e4-b4cb-a26f-1e9c3a9d7150 , where we’ll take a detailed look at your experience and personalize our feedback for you.

Early this morning Friday August 25 at 2:10 AM, a woman came up my steps to my porch and stole a pot of flowers (brand new) and also took flowers DIRECTLY out of my planter. She then got into her car, stayed there for about 17 minutes and then drove off at 2:27 AM. She appears to be intoxicated. Neighbors have additional footage that shows she was with another woman at the time and a man who drove the car when they left at 2:27 AM.
